ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
This project was made in summer 2018, it is my own twist on the board game "Arboretum". With the help from my 
Ex-professor who guided me through small bugs i managed to complete this game in a single day.

WHAT THIS PROJECT TAUGHT ME:

This was my first game made using classes and arrays at the same time, it help me visualise and conceptualize 3d array 
and it also introduced "lighting" type of physics, if there is an object it does not pass.
This was also the first game that had two players competing for the win with rounds and not limit to rounds 
unless one of them gives up.

This game also taught me, thanks to my professor who helped debug some parts, that a code can always be optimized no 
matter how hard the concept it. 

Multiple dimension arrays was also a subject tackled in this project.

Whats the future of this porject:

As i am still a student in computer engineering, this game will hopefully be made in a graphical enviroment using python
in a responsive and optimized qay
